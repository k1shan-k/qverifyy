      question: 'Why should my project get Qverified?',
      answer: "In an era where 'quantum-proof' can be a marketing gimmick, our third-party audit and public certification add credibility for users, developers, and investors. You'll stand out as a pioneer truly prepared for future adversaries."
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the certification take, and what does it cost?',
      answer: "Timeline: 4-6 weeks on average, depending on project size and complexity. As a nonprofit, we charge a cost-recovery fee. Typical audits range from $10k-$30k (USD), sliding scale based on project stage and funding. Exact quotes follow pre-qualification."
    },
    {
      question: 'Is this only for large blockchains, or can smaller projects apply?',
      answer: "We welcome projects of all sizesâ€”public chains, layer-2s, DeFi protocols, wallets, even small 'proof-of-concept' networks. We tailor our audit scope so you get meaningful feedback without overspending."
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if my project fails the audit?',
      answer: "You'll receive a detailed remediation report, including prioritized fixes. If you implement improvements within 90 days and resubmit, we'll re-audit at a discounted rate. All reports (including 'Not Certified') are published, so you can demonstrate your commitment to improvement."
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you accept self-assessment or only full audits?',
      answer: "We do offer a Self-Assessment Kit (free PDF), which walks you through a checklist. This helps you prepare before committing to a full audit. Only completed, verified audits earn the 'Qverify-Certified' seal."
